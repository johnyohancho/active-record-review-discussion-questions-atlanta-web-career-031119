# ActiveRecord Review Discussion

## ActiveRecord

Before we learned about ActiveRecord, we were able to call on a class method such as `Pet.all` which would return a collection of all the pet instances. That method would look like this:

```ruby
  class Pet
    # ...

    def self.all
      ALL
    end

    # ...
  end
```

When our class inherits from `ActiveRecord::Base`, we get the `all` method (and many more methods) for free.

Discuss with your table the steps involved in ActiveRecord's implementation of the class method `all`.  How is SQL used? What's the return value?

## Domain Modeling

With your table discuss how you would model out the relationships between three models `Voter`, `Vote`, and `Candidate`.  On which table do the foreign keys belong?

## AR Query Methods

Take a look at the following `Voter` class:

```ruby
class Voter < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :votes
  has_many :candidates, through: :votes
end
```

By providing the macros `has_many :votes` and `has_many :candidates, through: :votes`, ActiveRecord gives the `Voter` class the instance methods `Voter#votes` and `Voter#candidates`. These methods will fire some SQL, grab some rows from the database, and return the appropriate Ruby instances.

Your task is to discuss and write out the SQL statements that will run for each of the following expressions

```ruby
voter = Voter.create
#INSERT INTO voters (name) VALUES ("John");

candidate = Candidate.create
#INSERT INTO candidates (name) VALUES ("Obama");





voter.votes
#SELECT * FROM voters WHERE id = votes.voter_id;



voter.candidates
#SELECT * FROM candidates where id = votes.candidate_id;


vote = Vote.create(voter_id: voter.id, candidate_id: candidate.id)
#INSERT INTO votes (voter_id,candidate_id) VALUES (1,1);



vote = voter.votes.create(candidate: candidate)


vote.voter


```
